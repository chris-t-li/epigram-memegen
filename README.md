# epigram-memegen

This is a random meme generator. It uses the public api from imgflip: https://imgflip.com/api and pulls 100 most popular meme images.

The programming epigrams are from Alan Perlis: http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html.

Idea came from: https://github.com/dovid11564
